	       	   <p>Dear Dr. Divya,</p>
	       </div>
	       
	       <div id='cl-body'>
		       <p id='intro'>After learning about internship opportunities at PEC through a friend currently pursuing M.Tech from the university itself, I looked upon the internet to find out your contact details. After going through your profile, and papers I believe that I will be learning a lot by pursuing an internship under your guidance. However, so far I've only done web development related work, <b>I would like to undertake this internship as a rigorous and practical introduction to internet security</b>.</p>
		  <p id='sell'>I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated individual who can work independently if the need so arises. I'm extremely comfortable with web technologies (HTML,CSS,JS on client side) and (php and Apache on the sever side). Due to the training I recieved during grauation I was introduced to linux operating system and I'm always excited to work at a linux computer. Through the course of being involved as a web developer I have also picked up regular expressions and its various implementations such as awk,sed and grep to work with files and large texts comfortably. Also, due to my interests in learning new programming languages I have learned Java and Python to a level where I'm comfortable producing code in both of these languages. I'm well versed with OOP concepts and regularly employee OO concepts in my programming practices. I had computer science as one of the courses during high school during which I learned C/C++, datastructures and MySql. Of These I later developed proficiency in MySql to assist my web development tasks. I'm also aware of identifying and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. You can further check my development works (, especially a simple console game built with python3) on my <a href='https://github.com/iniquity92'>Git</a>. This resume and cover letter is built with HTML,CSS using vim text editor and the pdf is built using <a href='www.princexml.com'>Prince</a>. Source code available on <a href='https://github.com/iniquity92'>Git</a>.</p>
                  <p id='util'>Along with learning the ropes of the field, I will extend my complete support in furthering your research works. I'm optimistic of being of use to you especially in cloud computing & security, cyber threat intelligence and malware analysis because of my experience with the software so far.</p>
		  <p id='cta'>After reviewing my application I'm sure you will agree that I will be a valuable addition to your team. I look forward to elaborating on how I would like to benefit with this internship at the same time giving you an opportunity to gauge my usefulness towards your goals. Please contact me at +91-9033104947 or via email at <a href='mailto:abhishek.singh.121192@gmail.com'>abhishek.singh.121192@gmail.com</a>.</p>

		  <p>Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
		<p>Yours Sincerely,<br />
		Abhishek Singh</p>
